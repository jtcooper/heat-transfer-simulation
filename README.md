# Heat Transfer Simulation

The repo includes an executable, so installing Go is not required to run the simulation.

Steps to run:

```
git clone https://github.com/jtcooper/heat-transfer-simulation.git
cd heat-transfer-simulation
./heat-transfer-simulation
```

The simulation outputs three HTML files:
* `TemperatureSeries.html` plots temperature of the solar panel and storage tank
* `SolarPanelSeries.html` plots the heat transfer values for the solar panel
* `StorageTankSeries.html` plots the heat transfer values for the storage tank
